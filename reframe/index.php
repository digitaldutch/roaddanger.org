LONDON - A girl was killed, and several other children were injured on Thursday after a car ploughed into a primary school building in south-west London, triggering a major response by emergency services.

The crash at the private Study Prep girls' school in Wimbledon, was not being treated by police as terror-related, and the driver – a woman in her 40s who stopped at the scene – was arrested.

She was detained on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, London's Metropolitan Police said, confirming the death of the child.

Earlier, the force said seven children and two adults were injured in the crash, and the local MP said he understood several casualties were &quot;being treated as critical&quot;.

Mr Stephen Hammond described the crash as &quot;extraordinarily distressing and tragic&quot;.

Aerial footage of the scene – not far from where the Wimbledon tennis tournament was taking place – showed a Land Rover car stopped at an angle against the wall of the modern school building.">
